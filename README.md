#### INSPIRATION
Our project is depends on [watch and code/Practical Javascript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) 



### TECHNOLOGIES

#### Notes

* this project gives me an idea about how should I write a big function and how should I divide the project.
* review all lessons we learned before is very good before start a new lesson.

##### We struggled with:

* organizing functions in an object is a bit diffucult.
* at the end refactoring code in different javascript files are diffucult. I should take a long way.
